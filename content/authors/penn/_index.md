I am an ecologist and data scientist with a passion for learning new things. I try to live by Feynman's First Principal: *you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool*. That's how I first became interested in statistics, the philosophy of science, and reproducible research in computational science. My love of building things and solving puzzles hooked me on programming, and I've found R to be a particularly good fit to my interests in ecological statistics and data visualization.

I think that some of the most interesting challenges in ecology right now pertain to how we make can make the best inference from the wealth of data readily available to us. Two of those challenges are particularly interesting to me: spatially explicit inference, and data of uncertain or heterogeneous quality.

When I'm not at a computer or spending time with my family, I prefer to be outside. I'm a trail runner, and I usually take a camera with me because it encourages me to stop and look around more. Most of the photos in the Gallery were taken on runs.
