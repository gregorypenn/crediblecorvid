abstract: Presence-only data in ecology is the product of joint processes of species occurrance and human observation. Modeling these processes directly enables estimation of species abundance or probability of occurrance in absolute terms without prior knowledge of prevalance. This approach is validated with simulated data and applied to a community-science dataset.

I was going to give this talk in Salt Lake City at ESA 2020. The conference has moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, so I recorded it and you can watch it below.
