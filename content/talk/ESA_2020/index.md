abstract: Presence-only data in ecology is the product of joint processes of species occurrance and human observation. Modeling these processes directly enables estimation of species abundance or probability of occurrance in absolute terms without prior knowledge of prevalance. This approach is validated with simulated data and applied to a community-science dataset.

Let me know if you'd like me to put the slides up here. I'm not sure they'd be useful without the accompanying talk.
