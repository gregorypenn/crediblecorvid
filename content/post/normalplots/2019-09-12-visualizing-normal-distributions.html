<p><em>An exercise in effective visualization and reusable code</em></p>
<p>This post describes the development of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a> code with <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html">ggplot2</a> for visualizing normal distributions, which can easily be extended to other distributions. The example illustrates some useful concepts related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective visualizations</li>
<li>Reusable code</li>
<li>Functional programming</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Motivation:</em> Visualizing distributions of random variables is one of those things that I seem to be doing all the time. So time spent developing reusable code for the purpose has been worthwhile. One dividend has been a small library of functions that simplify visualizing different parameterizations of canonical distributions. The goal is to have a simple function that produces a useful visualization from no more parameters than necessary.</p>
<p>The following sections illustrate incremental improvements and the thought process that drives them. If you find this too basic, skip to the <a href="#final">finished function</a> at the end. References to ggplot functions in the text are hyperlinked to their <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html">documentation</a>, where you can find a lot more options and information.</p>
