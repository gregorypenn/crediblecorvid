I used to work with medium and large format film cameras, but most of the places I want to photograph are not easily accessible, even on foot. So I worked out a method for producing high-resolution images with equipment that's easy to carry, even on a six hour trail run. Most of the photos in this gallery were taken on runs using a compact Sony RX100 digital camera. The panoramas were stiched later using AutoPano Giga.
